Openai response for hey Jarvis using AI write a program to generate library for maths
*************************************************************************

Creating a library for basic mathematical operations can be a great way to practice coding. Below is an example of how to write a simple mathematical library in Python. This library includes some fundamental mathematical functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, factorial, and finding the greatest common divisor (GCD).

### Python Math Library

```python
# math_library.py

import math

class MathLibrary:
    
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        """Returns the sum of a and b."""
        return a + b

    @staticmethod
    def subtract(a, b):
        """Returns the difference of a and b."""
        return a - b

    @staticmethod
    def multiply(a, b):
        """Returns the product of a and b."""
        return a * b

    @staticmethod
    def divide(a, b):
        """Returns the quotient of a and b. Raises an error if b is zero."""
        if b == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero.")
        return a / b

    @staticmethod
    def power(base, exponent):
        """Returns base raised to the power of exponent."""
        return pow(base, exponent)

    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        """Returns the factorial of n. Raises an error if n is negative."""
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
        return math.factorial(n)

    @staticmethod
    def gcd(a, b):
        """Returns the greatest common divisor of a and b."""
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return abs(a)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    math_lib = MathLibrary()
    
    print("Addition: ", math_lib.add(3, 5))
    print("Subtraction: ", math_lib.subtract(10, 4))
    print("Multiplication: ", math_lib.multiply(6, 7))
    print("Division: ", math_lib.divide(20, 4))
    print("Power: ", math_lib.power(2, 3))
    print("Factorial: ", math_lib.factorial(5))
    print("GCD: ", math_lib.gcd(48, 18))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Class Creation**: We define a class `MathLibrary` which will encapsulate all the mathematical functions.
2. **Static Methods**: We use `@staticmethod` to allow calling the methods without instantiating the class. This is useful when the methods don't rely on instance attributes.
3. **Functionality**: It includes functions for basic arithmetic, as well as more advanced functions like factorial and GCD.
4. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for division by zero and factorial of negative numbers is included.

### How to Run:
1. Copy the code into a file named `math_library.py`.
2. You can run the script directly, or you can import the library into other Python scripts to use its functionalities.

This implementation can be expanded to include more complex mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, or matrix operations as needed.
